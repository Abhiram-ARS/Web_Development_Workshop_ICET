# ToDo_List_WebApp
The To-Do List web application allows users to efficiently add and delete tasks within a simple, interactive interface. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides a user-friendly platform to help individuals organize and track their tasks.

Key Features:

Task Management: Users can add new tasks by typing them into an input field and clicking an "Add Task" button. If the input field is left blank, an alert will prompt the user to enter a valid task.

Task Deletion: Each task has an associated delete button (❌). When clicked, the task is removed from the list, making it easy to manage completed or unnecessary tasks.

User Interface: The application is styled with a clean layout. The task container is centered on the page, and tasks are displayed in an organized list. The background and buttons are color-coordinated to ensure a visually appealing experience.

Responsive Design: The layout uses flexbox for centering and adapting to different screen sizes, ensuring the app is usable across devices.

This project demonstrates the core concepts of web development, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS styling, while offering a straightforward, interactive solution to task management.
